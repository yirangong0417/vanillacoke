# This set of codes provides (1) estimation on a nested logit model; (2) using the nested logit estimates to simulate a baseline counterfactual where a new product was removed from the choice set and calculating the changes in firms' profit under this baseline counterfactual; and (3) using the structural estimates and baseline profit estimates to simulate a new counterfactual where rival firms change their prices by a certain ratio so that profits from the new product change to a new given level (higher than what are computed from the baseline counterfactual).
# product.csv is a small simulated data set.
# To do (1), run nestedlogit.do in Stata.
# To do (2), run profits_main.m in MATLAB.
# To do (3), run required_levels_main.m in MATLAB.
